## percy

Looking for [`@percy/cli`](https://github.com/percy/cli)?

This package is installed when somebody uses a package manager's exec command to
run `percy` without first installing `@percy/cli`. When run, it prints a message
to stderr informing the user that `@percy/cli` is not installed and then exits.

To avoid accidentally installing this package when using a package manager's
exec command, most package managers accept the package's name:

``` session
$ npx @percy/cli --help
$ yarn dlx @percy/cli --help
$ pnpm dlx @percy/cli --help
```
